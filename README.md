> Typescript and Express generator with best practices and lean depenencies

## Intro
This generator is used for writing Express apps with Typescript.

After using Express/Node/AngularJS/MongoDB for 2 years, What I have noticed with large JS based projects, is that it slowly becomes un-maintainable due to the lack of tooling with JS. Auto-complete, compile time checks, and strong typing are tools we take for granted, and is really a nessesity for large scale applications. Without those aforementioned tools, large projects would slowly turn into this "read-only" state where you are too afraid to change or refactor code because you wouldn't know what the consequences are!

So I built this with a series of other generators to tackle this problem, with the help of Typescript.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-typescript-express using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-typescript-express
```

Make sure you have ```typescript``` and ```tsd``` (for typescript definitions) installed

```bash
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g tsd
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo typescript-express
```

Afterwards, the project will run ```npm install```, but you would need to run ```tsd install``` on your project root:

```bash
tsd install
```

## Usage

After the project is scaffolded, you must build the project. You can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [```atom-typescript```](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript), or go hardcore with the ```tsc``` command. This will create a ```/build``` folder with the built ```.js``` filtes.

Run ```gulp serve``` on the root, where the ```gulpfile.js``` is located to run the project locally to serve a local server on port 9000:

```bash
gulp serve
```

Get [PostMan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) or equivalent, and send a GET request to:

```
http://localhost:9000/thing/
```

Which will get you a nice response back.

## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He&#39;s a person with feelings and opinions, but he&#39;s very easy to work with. If you think he&#39;s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).
